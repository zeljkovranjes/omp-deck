#
# omp-deck — single-image build.
#
# Stage 1 builds the web bundle with Vite. Stage 2 is a slim runtime that runs
# the Bun server (which natively executes .ts), serves the built web bundle as
# static files, and bridges into the embedded @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent SDK.
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t omp-deck .
#
# Run (loopback, expose via Tailscale Funnel / SSH tunnel on host):
#   docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
#     -v omp-deck-agent:/root/.omp/agent \
#     -e OMP_DECK_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
#     -e OMP_DECK_PORT=8787 \
#     omp-deck

# ─── Stage 1: build web ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `oven/bun:<ver>` is the Debian-slim variant (glibc). We avoid `-alpine`
# because `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives` ships prebuilt `.node` binaries linked
# against glibc's `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`; Alpine's musl libc would fail
# to load them at runtime (no `linux-x64-musl` variant exists).
